This is the README for seDirector.

Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for seDirector.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using seDirector, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/AsherSoftware/seDirector/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- which game you're reporting the bug on (if applicable)
- a detailed description of the issue, including any error messages
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block, or if long, inside a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- Your Windows version (i.e. Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard)
- seDirector version
- anything else that you think may be useful

Feature Requests
-------------------

If you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/AsherSoftware/seDirector/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.

If it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:

 - A clear description of what exactly you want
 - Justification as to why this is something that is needed
 - Why we should do this feature rather than doing some other feature on the list

Remember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it.  We're mostly going to be focused on existing bugs rather than enhancing these games.  That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear.  Be concise.

Thank You

As always, we appreciate your interest and support in seDirector!
